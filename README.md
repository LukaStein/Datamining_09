### What is it about?

People with Parkinson's disease are distinguished from healthy people. In this study, measurements were taken in people with a voice disorder (dysphonia).
The **intention** is to distinguish healthy people from sick people based on different types of frequency measurements. This is a supervised dataset, because
a column called *status* is provided in advance, which distinguishes individuals with 0 (healthy) and 1 (sick).
